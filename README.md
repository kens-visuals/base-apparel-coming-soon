## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

Another fun project with Vanilla JS and some new things to experiment with. This time I've experimented with form and validations. It was a lot of fun, and not as challenging as I was expecting it to be. Moreover, I've got to experiment with CSS background and its positioning, which always confused me, now after this project everything is clear. Also, I think I've got a good hang of the responsive development, which seemed unreal just a couple of months ago.
